Code snippet
```

Pressing return twice at the end of a line will

create a new paragraph.

Adding two spaces at the end of a line  
acts as a simple line break.

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-4">Regular HTML...</div>
  <div class="col-sm-4">with Bootstrap row/col classes... </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4">will also work.</div>
</div>
